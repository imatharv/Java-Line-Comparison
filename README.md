### Hi there <img width="23px"  style="margin-bottom:-2.5px; margin-left:3px;" src="https://emojipedia-us.s3.dualstack.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/thumbs/120/apple/271/waving-hand_1f44b.png" />

<br />

The repository contains a core java program to compare two lines based on their end points using basic core java concepts.
 
<br />

> _Every branch contains step wise code. And the master branch is same as of the last branch._

<br />

### Branching details,

- [Use Case 1](https://github.com/imatharv/Java-Line-Comparison/tree/use-case-1) Model a line based on a point consisting of (x, y) co-ordinates using the cartesian system, and calculate its length
- [Use Case 2](https://github.com/imatharv/Java-Line-Comparison/tree/use-case-2) Check the equility of two lines like are they equel or unequal based on end points
- [Use Case 3](https://github.com/imatharv/Java-Line-Comparison/tree/use-case-3) Compare two lines based on their end points, check first line is equal or longer or shorter than the second line
- [Use Case 4](https://github.com/imatharv/Java-Line-Comparison/tree/use-case-4) Refactor the code using compareTo as well as equalTo methods
